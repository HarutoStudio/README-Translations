# README-Translations

Welcome to the README translations repository! This is the English version.

**README-Translations** is an open-source repository focused on translating README files of open-source projects. This repository allows developers to translate project documentation, comments, and interfaces into Chinese or other languages, helping users worldwide easily understand and use these tools. You can participate in the translation effort and help bring excellent open-source projects to a wider audience.

## Available Translations:
- [English](README.md)
- [繁體中文](README-zh-Hant.md)

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository and create your own branch.
2. Work on your translation in your branch.
3. Submit the translation file in Markdown format and follow the naming conventions.
4. Once done, submit a **Pull Request** and indicate the original location and the language of the translation.
5. Provide a brief description of your translation in the PR (e.g., what content was translated or any changes made).

## Translation Guidelines

Translations should adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Faithfulness to the Original**: Translations should accurately reflect the original content, avoiding significant modifications or omissions.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Translations should be clear and concise, avoiding lengthy or overly complicated sentences.
- **Avoid Machine Translation**: If machine translation is used, ensure it is manually reviewed and corrected to ensure accuracy and readability.
- **Consistency of Terminology**: For technical terms or commonly used phrases, try to maintain consistency, referring to existing translation documents or glossaries.

## Translation Quality Requirements

- **Proofreading**: Every translation Pull Request should be proofread by at least one other contributor to ensure accuracy and correct grammar.
- **Issue Feedback**: If there is any uncertainty during the translation process, please raise an issue on the **Issues** page or add comments within the Pull Request.

## Important Notes

1. **Open and Public Repositories**: The README being translated must come from a public and open-source repository to ensure it complies with open-source contribution guidelines.
2. **No Duplicate Translations**: Before submitting a translation, please check if the project already has a translation in the same language. If a translation already exists, avoid submitting a duplicate.
3. **Translation Quality Assurance**: Translations should faithfully reflect the original content, adhering to the project's style and terminology. If any terms are uncertain, please refer to existing translations or discuss with other contributors.
4. **Respect the Original Authors**: Translations should respect the intent and content of the original author, avoiding excessive modification or distortion of meaning.
5. **Copyright Compliance**: All translations should comply with the licensing terms of the original project and be distributed under the same terms.
6. **Multilingual Support**: Currently, we primarily support Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese translations. Contributors who can translate into other languages are welcome to do so.

## Naming Conventions

To maintain clarity and organization in the repository, please follow these naming conventions:

- Translation files for each open-source project should be placed in a folder named after the project.
- **Folder Name**: The folder name for each project should match the project’s name.
  - **Example**: `super-awesome-project/`

- **Translation File Naming**: Translation files should be named in the format `README-<language-code>.md`, where `<language-code>` is the language code.
  - `en` = English
  - `zh-Hans` = Simplified Chinese
  - `zh-Hant` = Traditional Chinese
  - `ja` = Japanese
  - `es` = Spanish

### Example

Suppose there is an open-source project named `super-awesome-app`, and we want to submit translations in Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. The folder structure should look like this:

```
super-awesome-app/
├── README-en.md                  # English version of the README
├── README-zh-Hans.md             # Simplified Chinese translation
├── README-zh-Hant.md             # Traditional Chinese translation
```
